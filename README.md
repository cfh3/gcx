# gcx
Requires python 3.10.1 with `pytest`, `selenium`, `webdriver-manager` packages.

Must have environment variables set for `GCXUSERNAME` and `GCXPASSWORD`.

To run the tests, run `pytest -s` from the project root directory.

TODO:
- implement BasePage
- add assertions to prove the tests pass or fail
- make it robust...still pretty flaky
